> Do I really have to make a UML diagram. What is this? CMPUT 301

Basically going have to refactor most of my code because last year I wasn't the smartest boy on the planet. Still not so I gotta do this. Place is a mess and I really need to make a diagram. One thing last year me did well is get a job at a small indie company called Microsoft so I get to use Visio and pretend like I'm actually working.
