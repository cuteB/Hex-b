## I'm Thinkin Chains

So I got agent smart to pick the best moves. The problem is it it doesn't know how they work. Thats where the chain comes in.

### Bonus Points

There needs to be taking each hex. How else would you pick them. There will need to be two bonus points to each hex.The first, for both players, will give hexes closer to the center more value. Next one for each player, Closer to their side is better. Leave the top and bottom at zero because they don't matter until they matter.

### Chain value

Kinda obvious thinking back. The whole game is about making a path but the smartest make chains. Chains only care about extending their length. Longer chains get to the end better. Ends gotta know when they are touching the end zone. Obviously fix weak connections but that is ezpz.
