![Winning in three moves. Almost](/wiki/images/DidIJustWinIn3Moves.png)

Ok so red (Agent_A*) is dumb for letting me do this but still. Blue won in three moves and red can't do anything about it. This is a big case for contesting the middle and not allowing this to happen. This is the only state that can be won with three moves. If there is a shift by one then one of the sides doesn't have enough space to allow the [4 away](#4-away-connection) moves to do their thing.
