> Hexes are bit different than Hexagons. Hexagons are the shape and Hexes are my pride and joy. 

## Running the game

The quickest way to play a game is to run the command.

```bash
$ python main.py -b yourname
```

This will open up a game where you are the blue player against a simple A* agent as the red player.

### Game Flags

This section has the same information as the `--help` flag.
